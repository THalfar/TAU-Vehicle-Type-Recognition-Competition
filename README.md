This repo contains the code with which I participated in the [TAU Vehicle Type Recognition Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vehicle/overview) .
Due to the nature of the competition, this is the outcome of a private repo.
A more detailed description of the approach can be found on the competition's [discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vehicle/discussion/121883).
